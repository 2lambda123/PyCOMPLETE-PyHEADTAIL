PyHEADTAIL
==========

CERN PyHEADTAIL numerical n-body simulation code 
for simulating macro-particle beam dynamics with collective effects.

Currently only a git-clone of the repository is supported.
The available zip files on github are missing the versioning 
and will not allow ./install to work.
